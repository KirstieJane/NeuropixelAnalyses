## Intro to the file 

## Set Up
    # numpy
    # pandas 
    # matplotlib 
    # matplotlib figure set up

    #import the files 
    # ouput the files into a folder within the working directory 
    # throw an error message if the file hasn't been successfully downloaded

## View the data 
    # load in the dataset so that I can use it
    # link to the documentation on the dataset 

    # print out the keys
    # what is the data (maybe shape/type for each key) 

    # make a table

## Do some data manipulation so I can group the mice 

    # group the mice by name 
    # group the brain areas by region 
    ### this is because I wanted to see if there was information flow that could predict motor outcome 

    ### Data viz to see what's going on with the neurons 
        ## use Cori (session 4) and plot his visual response

    # plot the regions spike rates 
        # TBD: change it to freq 

    



Next Steps:
# what's the spiking in the different brain areas? 

# let's line these plots up vertically and add the stimuli onset and cue bars and make the axes the same 

# is this seen across mice?

# what's the difference between mice? 

# predictions (correct response by area?)

# correlation between areas and movement
